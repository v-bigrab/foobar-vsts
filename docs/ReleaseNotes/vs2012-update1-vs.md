# Visual Studio 2012 Update 1

### November 26, 2012

Visual Studio 2012 Update 1 (Visual Studio 2012.1) provides enhancements and fixes to address a variety of issues reported through Connect and Windows Error Reporting. In addition, Update 1 delivers a wealth of new functionality into Visual Studio 2012. Most of the new functionality appears in Ultimate and Premium, but there are some features for Professional and Express products, too. The new functionality in Update 1 primarily spans four key areas:

* Windows development
* SharePoint development
* Agile teams
* Continuous quality

## Download
You can download Visual Studio 2012 and Team Foundation Server 2012 from [My.VisualStudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/). My.VisualStudio.com requires a free [Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/) subscription, or a [Visual Studio Subscription](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/).

## Windows development

For the release of Windows 8, Visual Studio 2012 added new templates, designers, and testing & debugging tools to support this new platform, including support for Windows Store apps with the Windows 8 Simulator. Update 1 adds support for mixed-mode (managed/native) debugging of Windows Store apps, and support for native ARM dump debugging. This update also includes code analysis support for Windows Phone 8 apps. But Update 1 isn’t just about new Windows platforms. It also enables you to target Windows XP with native C++ applications in Visual Studio 2012.

## SharePoint development

With Update 1, we also invested in expanding our lifecycle tools for SharePoint 2010, especially for testing and quality assurance. You can now use unit tests and coded UI tests for simulating user interaction, including the Microsoft Fakes Framework to stub out SharePoint dependencies. Load testing support enables stress testing of SharePoint applications under simulated load and network conditions. In addition, you can now capture SharePoint logging information using IntelliTrace to provide a rich analysis experience for SharePoint applications.

## Agile teams

Visual Studio 2012 brought a lot of new features to support the work of agile teams. Update 1 builds upon these advancements with significant usability improvements in Team Foundation Server’s web interface and a much improved source viewing and diffing experience. Update 1 also includes functionality for Team Foundation Server that first appeared in Team Foundation Service, such as Kanban support with a Kanban board and a cumulative flow diagram. In the IDE, Code Maps enable you to create and view dynamic visualizations of relevant code to understand and navigate its relationships faster.

## Continuous quality

Enabling continuous quality is a key focus area of Update 1. Code coverage for automated tests is now available for manual testing, which enables you to analyze which areas of a code base are used during manual testing. Update 1 also supports cross-browser testing, with the ability to record web tests in Internet Explorer and then later replay them with most modern browsers. Using Test Explorer, you can group and run tests based on their traits (Test Category, Test Property, Priority, and Owner). You can also pause and resume manual test sessions in Microsoft Test Manager, and automatically create an image log of all actions performed during an exploratory testing session.
