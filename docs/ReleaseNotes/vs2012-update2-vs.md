# Visual Studio 2012 Update 2

### April 4, 2013

Visual Studio 2012 Update 2 (Visual Studio 2012.2) is a cumulative release that also includes all of the benefits delivered in Update 1. As part of Visual Studio’s commitment to continuous delivery, this release has enhancements that span feature areas across all editions, with a special focus on the modern lifecycle capabilities introduced in Premium and Ultimate. The new functionality in Update 2 focuses on four key areas:

- Agile planning
- Quality enablement
- Line-of-business (LOB) application development
- Developer experience

## Download
You can download Visual Studio 2012 and Team Foundation Server 2012 from [My.VisualStudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/). My.VisualStudio.com requires a free [Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/) subscription, or a [Visual Studio Subscription](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/).

## Agile planning

Visual Studio 2012 introduced a new set of capabilities to support agile teams—on their terms. Update 2 adds new capabilities for your team to customize and get more out of its agile tooling. You can now add customizable columns to your Kanban boards so that they more accurately reflect your organization’s structure. Work item tagging helps teams to manage their work items by adding tags to get more out of their data.

## Quality enablement

Maintaining quality throughout the development cycle is one of the key focus areas for Visual Studio 2012. In Update 2, you can continue to drive quality wherever you are through web access for Test Case Management. You can author and execute test cases remotely, making it easier for all members of your team to participate in test case reviews. You can also profile your unit tests to create better code by tracking the end to end flow of your code, including the unit test itself.

## Line-of-business (LOB) application development

With Update 2 we continue to invest in making it easier for you to develop LOB applications. You can quickly create SharePoint apps and HTML5 client apps using LightSwitch. Just design your app and let the LightSwitch templates provide the fit and finish so you can get your LOB applications running quickly. With the addition of WPF, Silverlight and SketchFlow to Blend for Visual Studio, now you have everything you need for designing and coding your desktop applications in Visual Studio.

## Developer experience

When you spend a lot of time developing software, you want tools that will provide an enjoyable developer experience. Update 2 includes enhancements and updates to improve the developer experience for Visual Studio 2012. Code map debugger integration gives you a visual representation of your code while debugging so you can identify issues faster. You can also create great apps for Windows Store using profiling enhancements to find issues earlier that could impact your users.
