### What's New in this Release

#### <a id="te"> </a> A New Team Explorer Standalone Install

Visual Studio Team Explorer 2017 is a rich, standalone client (Figure 1) used to access Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Team Services. It is free for any user. This [install](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=TeamExplorer&rel=15) only includes Team Explorer so you can access version control and work item tracking without other IDE components.

#### <a id="UWP-1703"> </a> Tools for Universal Windows App Development

The Universal Windows App workload now includes the Creators Update SDK (10.0.15063) and allows you to build apps for the Windows 10 Creators Update version 1703. 
In addition, the release includes these enhancements:
* The Windows 10 SDK will install side by side with the Creators Update SDK. This allows you to use a single machine to build production-ready apps that target the released version of the SDK, as well as begin testing new OS features delivered by a Preview Windows SDK.
* NuGet package management has been improved by using [PackageReference](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files) to replace 
package.config and package.json.
* An enhanced .NET Native Compiler that is now delivered as a NuGet package.
* Visual Studio now includes improved tooling support for XAML controls delivered as NuGet packages.
* IntelliSense in the XAML editor now highlights XAML types and properties that are not supported in the version of the SDK that your app is targeting.
