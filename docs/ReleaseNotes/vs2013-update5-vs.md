# Visual Studio 2013 Update 5 (2013.5) RTM

### July 20, 2015

Today, we are happy to announce the availability of the Visual Studio 2013 and Team Foundation Server 2013 Update 5 Release to Manufacturing (RTM).

**Download:** You can download Visual Studio 2013 from [My.VisualStudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/). My.VisualStudio.com requires a free [Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/) subscription, or a [Visual Studio Subscription](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/).

This update is the latest in a cumulative series of technology improvements and bug fixes for Visual Studio 2013. Periodic updates enable us to enhance and expand both Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server more frequently to support the latest software development innovations for building and managing modern apps.

**Note:** Support for Visual Studio 2013 is only provided on this current update, which is considered the Visual Studio 2013 Service Pack. The Visual Studio 2013 RTM version, released in November of 2013, will only be supported for one year after the release of this current update. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle).

**Also note:** All prior releases of the Tools for Apache Cordova are incompatible with Update 5. If you have previously installed a Tools for Apache Cordova CTP extension, you must uninstall that extension before installing Visual Studio 2013 Update 5. If you require Apache Cordova support, we encourage you to try [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-vs).

### What's new in Visual Studio 2013 Update 5

#### Cloud-based load testing from Azure datacenters worldwide

Setting up the infrastructure required to run load testing by using the Visual Studio Team Foundation Service just got easier: Now, you can perform cloud-based load testing from any of the supported Azure datacenters around the world.

Learn more about [choosing a location for your load test](http://aka.ms/geotarget).

#### Current iteration query token

You now can run queries in Visual Studio with the @currentIteration token on Visual Studio Online or Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2015.

Learn more about the [current iteration query token](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/2015-mar-10-vso.aspx).

#### Team Project Rename support for Local Workspaces

We've included the ability to update [local workspaces](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb892960.aspx#local) after a team project is renamed. Performing a get or check-in will automatically correct the workspace mapping so that it uses the new team project name.
