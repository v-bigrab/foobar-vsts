### What's New in this Release

#### <a id="tesolutions"> </a> Solutions shown in Team Explorer

Solutions have been brought back to Team Explorer, due to your [feedback](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/34779/bring-back-showing-solutions-file-in-team-explorer.html).

#### <a id="xamarin"> </a> Property Pages and Manifests Redesign

In Xamarin 4.5 we've started a redesign of our Property Pages and Manifest editors. Looking for consistency with Visual Studio itself and Visual Studio for Mac, our new property pages were reorganized and simplified, supporting high-DPI displays. We've also split editors in more natural way. Now you can keep editing csproj options from the Property Pages, and manifest options from the manifest editor.

Please visit the [Xamarin release notes](https://developer.xamarin.com/releases/vs/xamarin.vs_4/xamarin.vs_4.5/) for full details.

### What's New in this Release

#### <a id="datascience"> </a> Data Science and Analytical Applications Workload

The Data science and analytical applications workload provides a one-click install of all your data analysis needs. It includes support for Python, R, F#, and their respective packages/distros to enable acquisition, analysis, and visualization of data all the way through to building and deploying machine learning models.

#### <a id="typescript"> </a> TypeScript Side-by-Side Support

Multiple versions of the TypeScript compiler may now be used in Visual Studio 2017. During installation, TypeScript 2.2 will be automatically included with the Web, Node.js, Universal Windows, or Mobile JavaScript workloads. TypeScript 2.1 may also be selected from the 'Individual Components' installer page.

By default, the version of TypeScript used by IntelliSense *(Figure 2)* and by the build will be the latest installed. To change the version used by IntelliSense, use the "Tools / Options / Text Editor / JavaScript/TypeScript / IntelliSense" setting shown below. To change the TypeScript version used for building a project, set the MSBuild property `<TypeScriptToolsVersions>` in the project file (see [the TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options-in-msbuild.html) for more info on MSBuild properties).

When [installing Visual Studio 2017 using the command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio)
you can pass `--cache` to enable the caching policy (default) for the install and subsequent install, modify, and repair operations; or you can pass `--nocache` to disable the policy
which will prevent packages from being cached and remove any packages already cached for the current instance.

The policy can also be changed through the registry and group policy. See [our setup blog](https://aka.ms/setup/nocache) for more information.
