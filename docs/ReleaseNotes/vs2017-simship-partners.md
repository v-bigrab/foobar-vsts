# Visual Studio 2017 Extension Sim-Ship Partners

The power of Visual Studio is increased by the thousands of extensions that allow you to customize or enhance your development experience 
and increase your productivity. With each new release of Visual Studio, we invite partners to migrate their extensions so that they can 
take advantage of the latest features in Visual Studio. Below, and on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3A%22Sim-ship%20VS%202017%22&target=VS&sortBy=Downloads), 
you'll find a list of more than 250 extensions that are ready for you to install with [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes) 
today. As additional extensions are migrated to Visual Studio 2017, you can find them on the 
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VS&category=All%20categories&vsVersion=vs15&sortBy=Downloads).

Extensions providers that are marked with "Basic Partner", "Alliance Partner", or "Premier Partner" are ones who participate in the 
[Visual Studio Partner Program](https://vspartner.com/). If you author an extension, we encourage you to join the Partner Program.
