## What's New in this Version
### <a id="install"> </a>Installation Experience

We're delighted to introduce our new installer, which was designed from the ground up to:

* Reduce the minimum footprint of Visual Studio.
* Install more quickly, with less system impact, and uninstall cleanly.
* Make it easier for you to select and install just the features you need.

When you first install Visual Studio 2017, you'll see the new experience *(Figure 1)*:

<img src="media/VS_Installer_RTW.png" "The new installation experience in Visual Studio 2017" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 1) The new installation experience in Visual Studio 2017*</center>

The smallest install is just a few hundred megabytes, yet still contains basic code editing support for 
more than twenty languages including source code control. Most users will want to install
more. You can add one or more 'workloads' that represent common frameworks,
languages, and platforms - covering everything from .NET desktop development to game development with
Unity.

#### How to Update Visual Studio
To update Visual Studio, run the Visual Studio Installer and click the "Update" button.

#### Feedback on the New Installer
You can report problems or praise using the _Report a Problem_ and _Provide a Suggestion_  commands
from the new installer client in the upper right corner of the title bar. We want to know if you experience errors
installing, uninstalling, or modifying your installation, as well as abnormal installation
times (e.g. hangs) or unexpected error messages.

#### Creating a Layout for Offline Installation and New Command-Line Installation Support
System administrators and other users can now create an offline layout of Visual Studio that contains all content needed to
install the product without requiring internet access. This layout can be the full product, a subset of workloads and/or components, and one or
more product locales. Note that creating the offline layout requires internet access. For more information, see
[Create an offline installation of Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/create-an-offline-installation-of-visual-studio).

#### <a id="Nickname"> </a> Installation Nickname
Visual Studio Enterprise and Community (among other products) can now be installed side-by-side on the same computer.
To make identifying these installations simpler, you can specify a short name or "nickname".
For example, if you were to install Visual Studio Enterprise, and then install Community, both would appear the same on the start menu.
You can give the second one a nickname like "community", and the start menu items will appear with names such as "Visual Studio 2017 (community)" and "Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2017 (community)".

### <a id="vside"> </a> Visual Studio IDE
#### IDE Improvements
* Visual Studio has been optimized to reduce startup time and solution load time. The very first launch of Visual Studio is at least 50% faster.
* Visual Studio will now monitor extension performance that impacts startup, solution load, or editing. You will receive alerts about poorly performing extensions via the Notification bar in the IDE. The new Performance Center (also available via Help > Manage Visual Studio Performance) lets you view not only extensions that are impacting performance, but also discover tool windows that are impacting your startup performance and change their startup load behavior.
* The GitHub extension for Visual Studio can be selected in the new Visual Studio installer.
* Reload All Projects has been replaced with Reload Solution to support better performance when switching branches external to VS. When using the Git command line to switch branches, choose Reload Solution after the branch has switched to achieve the maximum performance improvement.
* File globbing capabilities for .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects have been enhanced. See [project file globbing](https://aka.ms/jcmh7k) for more details.
* You are now automatically taken to the folder view of your repository after cloning. You can view files or open Solutions with the new Solution selection list in the Solution Explorer.
* A new external service host is being introduced that will replace VSHub. This new service host is an external process and will appear in Task Manager as ServiceHub.Host.CLR.*.exe, as well as ServiceHub.Host.Node.x86.exe. This host will ultimately eliminate the localhost http traffic that was introduced with VSHub which should alleviate the noise Fiddler users reported.
* Pre-release license expiration messages more clearly communicate the current license state.
* The Account Settings dialog is now more accessible to screen readers.
* Offline help is now available by installing the Help Viewer component from the Visual Studio installer.
* You can now add and remove multiple user interface languages at any time using the Visual Studio installer on the Language Packs tab. You can select the current user interface language among those installed using Tools > Options > International Settings.
* The version control status bar makes it easier to publish local repos to an SCC host and keep track of uncommitted *(Figure 2)* and un-pushed work *(Figure 3)*.

<center>*(Figure 3) Version Control - No pending changes example*</center>

#### Sign In and Identity Improvements
We introduced a new identity service that allows you to share user accounts across Microsoft developer tools. Within Visual Studio, this sharing includes features such as Team Explorer, Azure Tools, Windows Store publishing, and more. These features now share a common and consistent sign in experience.

Along with improvements to Visual Studio, we have completed the deployment of some improvements on the service side that allow users to safely stay signed in and eliminate the forced sign in every 12 hours. This addresses the most commonly reported sign in issue.
[Learn more about fewer Visual Studio prompts](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/08/15/fewer-visual-studio-sign-in-prompts/).

#### Start Page
The [redesigned Start Page](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/11/29/harness-the-power-of-the-redesigned-start-page/) has new Open and Create facilities:
* Acquire remote repos from VSTS or use our more prominent MRU to open local projects and solutions easily.
* The Start Page MRU shows repos you've cloned on other machines so you can easily clone them on your current machine.
* Create a new project directly from the Start Page with searchable templates and a list of recently used templates. Recently used templates will also roam across Visual Studio instances with a personalization account.
* Quickly launch the new Clone from VSTS experience through the "Checkout from VSTS" option on the Start Page.
* A dismissible "Get Started" section.
* The News section is now collapsible:
  * Updated badge on newly added items in the News Feed.
  * Badge on News Feed expander if new items appear when the News Feed is collapsed.
*  Refined visual design to address feedback about truncated elements on smaller screens and utilization of empty space.

The new Start page is shown below *(Figure 4)*:

<img src="media/StartPage.png" alt="Start Page with Get Started and News" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 4) Start Page with Get Started and News*</center>

#### <a id="betternav"> </a>Improved Code Navigation
We've made significant improvements to code navigation features in Visual Studio 2017:

* Go To All (`Ctrl+`, or `Ctrl+ T`) lets you quickly find and go to files, types, methods, and other elements in your code. It allows you to locate items of any kind, even in large code bases. What’s more, if you know what kind of item you’re after, you can filter down easily. In C#, Visual Basic, and F#, we have also added "fuzzy" matching such that if you misspell a type name you will still get results. We've also modernized the Go To Line (`Ctrl + G`) experience. You can find the Go To family of commands at the top of the Edit Menu *(Figure 5)* and *(Figure 6)*.  

<img src="media/2VS2017RTMNavigationGoTo.png" alt="Go To Results Filtered" width="800" height="340" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 5) Go To Results Filtered*</center>

<img src="media/9GotoLine.png" alt="Go To Line" width="452" height="96" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 6) Go To Line*</center>

* Find All References (Shift+F12) has been overhauled (currently for C#, Visual Basic, F#, and C++), providing advanced grouping, filtering, sorting, searching within reference results, and colorization for results (for C# and VB), so you can get a clear understanding of your references and get to the line of code you need with confidence. On mouse hover on a reference item, a tooltip is displayed with the context of the reference in source code (for C# and VB). By toggling on the Keep Results button in the toolbar, the next invocation of Find All References will populate reference results in a new window. This allows you to keep the current results in the existing window *(Figure 7)*.

<img src="media/FindAllRerences.png" alt="Find All References" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 7) Find All Reference*</center>

* Structure Guide Lines are now drawn in the editor so that you can easily visualize the structure of the code that you are working in. On mouse hover, a tooltip *(Figure 8)* is displayed containing the context of the current code block relative to its ancestor blocks. Structure Guide Lines are currently supported for C#, Visual Basic, F#, and XAML files, and for any files supported via TextMate grammars. This feature may be disabled in the Tools > Options dialog by unchecking the *Show structure guide lines* checkbox under the *Text Editor* > *General* category.

<img src="media/Structure_Visualizer_CS_Tooltip-3.png" alt="Structure Guide Lines" width="333" height="165" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 8) Structure Guide Lines*</center>

#### Coding Convention Support via EditorConfig
The Visual Studio editor now supports [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org), which allows developers to define and maintain consistent coding style conventions between different editors and IDEs. See [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/create-portable-custom-editor-options) for more details, and [.NET documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/editorconfig-code-style-settings-reference) for information on how to use .editorconfig files to govern your .NET code style. See [known issues](vs2017-knownissues.md) for limitations in EditorConfig support in this release.

#### Open Folder
Open Folder is a convenient way for you to work with code bases without projects and solutions. Open Folder View
 from File > Open > Folder, and then select a folder to navigate.
You can open and edit files using the Solution Explorer *(Figure 9)*. Many popular languages have syntax highlighting and support
for symbol navigation (GoTo).

<img src="media/OpenFolder-3.png" alt="The new Open Folder feature in the Visual Studio IDE" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 9) The new Open Folder feature in Visual Studio IDE*</center>

Additionally, some languages have advanced IntelliSense and debugging support directly
from the folder:

* C++ (CMake).
* Node.js - JavaScript/TypeScript.
* C# & VB.

You can build or debug by using F5 and the file context menu in the Solution Explorer. For the best experience,
make sure you install the workload for the languages you are working with.

The folder view also supports the following:

* Search across the code in your folder with GoTo (`Ctrl+`).
* Scope the Solution Explorer folder view to subfolders.
* Open folders in Explorer or the Command Prompt from the Solution Explorer.
* Easily toggle between Solutions in the opened folder or repository with the Solution selection dropdown.
* Configure debug and launch settings with launch.vs.json. Right-click on a file that can be debugged and select Debug and Launch Settings.
* Configure tasks and customize build with tasks.vs.json. Right-click on any file and select Configure Task Settings.
* Launch.vs.json and tasks.vs.json have IntelliSense in the JSON editor.

The performance of opening folders and toggling between folder view and solution view has been drastically improved.

#### Lightweight Solution Load
Lightweight Solution load enables faster loading of large Solutions. It can provide substantial improvements in Solution load time and memory usage for large Solutions. The feature is not enabled by default and can be
enabled on a Solution-by-Solution basis or globally in the IDE. To enable globally, navigate to Tools > Options, select General under Projects and Solutions *(Figure 10)* or by searching for "Lightweight Solution load" with
Quick Launch. The feature can be turned on and off for individual Solutions in the Solution properties pane.

<img src="media/LightweightSolutionLoad.png" alt="The new Lightweight Solution load feature in the Visual Studio IDE" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 10) The new Lightweight Solution load feature Visual Studio IDE*</center>

Lightweight Solution Load is best suited for large solutions that contain C# or a mix of C# and C++ projects. You
may be prompted to enable the feature if we detect that you are working with large solutions. You can find more
details about this feature on the [Visual Studio blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/10/11/shorter-solution-load-time-in-visual-studio-15/).

Performance of full Solution builds has been improved substantially, now at parity with conventional Solution load.

#### Syntax Colorization, Autocomplete, Snippet, and "Navigate To" Search Support for More Languages
Building on the support we added in the Visual Studio 2015 updates, Visual Studio 2017 now supports syntax colorization and autocomplete for an increased range of languages.
In addition, some of these languages also support navigation via "Navigate To" (`Ctrl+`), and/or Code Snippets.

Files for the languages noted below, support these features in the new Visual Studio Core Editor even when
no workloads have been installed to explicitly support the language in question. If a workload that provides
language support is installed (e.g., the .NET Desktop Application Development workload, the Windows Desktop
App Development with C++ workload, etc.), then more extensive language
support including IntelliSense and other advanced language features like Light Bulbs may be provided.

Language file types listed by support level:
* Supports only Syntax Colorization and Autocomplete:
  * Bat, Clojure, CoffeeScript, CSS, Docker, F#, Groovy, INI, Jade, Javadoc, JSON, LESS, LUA, Make, Markdown ++, Objective-C, Perl, PowerShell, Python, Rust, ShaderLab, SQL, Visual Basic .NET, YAML.
* Supports Code Snippets (in addition to Syntax Colorization and Autocomplete):
  * CMake, C++, C#, Go, Groovy, HTML, Java, Javadoc, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, PHP, R, Ruby, Shellscript, Swift, XML.
* Supports Navigate To (in addition to Syntax Colorization and Autocomplete):
  * C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, TypeScript, Visual Basic.

#### Getting Started with Project Overview Pages
We have introduced a completely new getting started experience for freshly created projects. We've replaced current getting started pages with an Overview
tab in our new App Configuration Designer and focused the page on the actions that will get you up and running quickly! This has been enabled in ASP.NET 4.x ASP.NET Core, and Cordova projects *(Figure 11)*.

<img src="media/OverviewPage.png" alt="Project Overview" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 11) Project Overview*</center>

#### <a id="servicecapability"> </a>Connecting to Services Using Connected Services
In a previous release, this feature was named Service Capabilities. We've changed the name to Connected Services.

Connected Services is the modern "Add Connected Service" or "Add Service Reference" feature of Visual Studio 2017.
The Connected Services feature makes it easier to connect your app to services. A new node called "Connected Services"
is available in the Solution Explorer for Web and Mobile project types. Double-clicking this node will open a new full page
tab in Visual Studio where you can discover popular Microsoft services you can connect to.

Selecting a service on the Connected Services page *(Figure 12)* will invoke the Connected Services Wizard that configures your project,
and downloads the necessary NuGet packages to get you started coding against your service quickly and painlessly.

<img src="media/ConnectedServices.png" alt="Connected Services" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 12) Connected Services*</center>

#### <a id="quicklaunchinprod"> </a>In-Product Acquisition of Tools and Features
Visual Studio 2017 makes it easy to acquire additional workloads and components without leaving the IDE *(Figure 13)*. Leverage Quick Launch to find and kick-off the Visual Studio Installer for any Workload or Individual component.

<img src="media/in-prod-acquisition-quicklaunch.png" alt="In-product acquisition via Quick Launch" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 13) In-product acquisition via Quick Launch*</center>

If you can't find the templates you’re looking for, the Visual Studio Installer can also be opened from within the New Project dialog *(Figure 14)*.

### <a id="cplusplus"> </a> Visual C++
Visual Studio 2017 brings many updates and fixes to the Visual C++ environment. Thank you for reporting bugs! We've fixed over 250 bugs and reported issues in the compiler and tools, many submitted by customers through [Microsoft Connect](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio "Microsoft Connect").
In this release, we worked on performance improvement of the STL.
The new SQLite-based database engine is now being used by default. This will speed up database operations like Go To Definition and Find All References, and will significantly improve initial solution parse time. We now provide a more granular installation experience for installing the original C++ workload.
We have added selectable components that enable you to install just the tools that you need. CMake support in Visual Studio is ready for primetime! Load your CMake projects directly into VS and start coding now.
“Open Folder” C++ experience has been improved – so bring your source code to VS without the need to create any VS solutions and projects.
Navigate To is now known as Go To, an umbrella term for a set of new navigation filters. This will make it easier to find the right results, especially in larger code bases.

#### C++ Code Analysis
The C++ Core Checkers for enforcing the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) are now distributed with Visual Studio. Simply enable the checkers in the Code Analysis Extensions dialog in the project's property pages *(Figure 15)* and the extensions will be included when you run code analysis.

<img src="media/CppCoreCheck-2.png" alt="CppCoreCheck properties page" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 15) CppCoreCheck properties page*</center>

#### C++ Compiler
We've updated the C++ compiler and standard library with enhanced support for C++11 and C++14 features, as well as preliminary support for certain features expected to be in the C++17 standard. With support for generalized constexpr and NSDMI for aggregates, the compiler is complete for features added in the C++14 Standard. Note that the compiler still lacks a few features from the C++11 and C++98 Standards.
Visual Studio 2017 allows using /sdl with /await. We removed /rtc limitation with Coroutines.

This release brings several improvements in optimization and code generation. Some notable improvements include:  

* Improved code generation of loops: support for automatic vectorization of division of constant integers, better identification of memset patterns.
* Improved code security: improved emission of buffer overrun compiler diagnostics, and /guard:cf now guards switch statements that generate jump tables.
* The /debug:fastlink option has been improved to provide 30% faster link times on large components than in Visual Studio 2015.
* When using co-routines, the Experimental keyword "yield" (available under /await switch) has been removed. Your code should be updated to use the "co_yield” instead. For more information, see the [Visual C++ Team blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/01/27/yield-keyword-to-become-co_yield-in-vs-2017).

#### C++ Libraries

* [STL] Performance improvement of basic_string.
* [STL]  Added \<any\>, \<string_view\>, apply(), make_from_tuple().
* [STL] std::vector has been overhauled for correctness and performance.
* [STL] The STL now avoids dereferencing null fancy pointers.
* [STL] Added \<optional\>, \<variant\>, shared_ptr::weak_type, and \<cstdalign\>.
* [STL] Enabled C++14 constexpr in min/max/minmax(initializer_list) and min_element/max_element/minmax_element().
* [STL]Improved the performance of std::string/std::wstring's move constructors by more than 3x.
* [STL] For a complete list of STL improvements see: [Visual C++ Team blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/02/06/stl-fixes-in-vs-2017-rtm/).
* [ATL] Yet another set of name-lookup conformance fixes.
* [ATL] Existing move constructors and move assignment operators are now properly marked as non-throwing.
* [ATL] Un-suppress valid warning C4640 about thread safe init of local statics in atlstr.h.
* [ATL] Thread Safe Initialization of local statics was automatically turned off in the XP toolset when [using ATL AND building a DLL]. This is no longer the case. You can add /Zc:threadSafeInit- in your Project settings if having thread safe initialization off is desired.
* [AMP] Audited library and fixed typos.
* [VCRuntime] New header ‘cfguard.h’ for Control Flow Guard symbols.

#### C++ IDE
Configuration change performance is now better for C++ native projects and much better for C++/CLI projects. When a solution configuration is activated for the first time it will now be faster and all subsequent activations of this solution configuration will be almost instantaneous.

The new SQLite-based database engine is now being used by default. This will speed up database operations like Go To Definition and Find All References, and will significantly improve initial solution parse time. The setting has been moved to Tools > Options > Text Editor > C/C++ > Advanced (it was formerly under ...C/C++ > Experimental).

We've improved IntelliSense performance on projects and files not using precompiled headers – an Automatic Precompiled Header will be created for headers in the current file.

Other updates include:

* We've added error filtering and help for IntelliSense errors in the error list *(Figure 16)*. Clicking on the error column now allows for filtering *(Figure 17)*. Also, clicking on the specific errors or pressing F1 will launch an online search for the error message.

<img src="media/ErrorList2.png" alt="Error List Filtered" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 17) Error List Filtered*</center>

* Added the ability to filter Member List items by kind *(Figure 18)*.

<img src="media/mlfiltering-2.png" alt="Member List Filtered" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 18) Member List Filtered*</center>

* Added a new experimental Predictive IntelliSense feature that provides contextually-aware filtering of what appears in the Member List.
* The new Find All References UI includes information about whether you are reading from or writing to a variable in the results for C++ code.

* The Dot-to-Arrow IntelliSense feature has been moved from experimental to advanced, and is now enabled by default. The editor features Expand Scopes and Expand Precedence have also been moved from experimental to advanced.

* The experimental refactoring features Change Signature and Extract Function are now available by default.

* We've enabled the new experimental feature for C++ projects ‘Faster project load’. The next time you open a C++ project it will load faster, and the time after that it will load even faster!

* Improvements to the Open Folder experience. Edit, build, and debug your non-MSBuild C++ project by loading your sources through “Open Folder”. Customize the experience through these json files:
  * CppProperties.json to customize the IntelliSense and browsing experience.
  * Tasks.vs.json to customize the build steps.
  * Launch.vs.json to customize the debugging experience.

* C++ IntelliSense will work without the need to create a CppProperties.json file in the root folder. Along with this, we've added a new dropdown to allow users to easily switch between configurations provided by CMake and CppProperties.json files.
CMake support in Open Folder: opening CMake projects with “Open Folder” will automatically configure the environment for C++ editing, building and debugging.

* Further configuration is supported via a CMakeSettings.json file that sits in the same folder as the CMakeLists.txt file *(Figure 19)*.

<img src="media/cmake_cpp-19.png" alt="CMake Open Folder" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">

    * Discover the CMake support with a 10 min video: [CMake Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lKxJjV8r3Y&t=2s).
* Linux development with C++: see the video [Linux Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIiFuBczd6A).

#### C++ Installation Workloads
* Windows Desktop Development with C++:  

    * We now provide a more granular installation experience for installing the original C++ workload. We have added selectable components that enable you to install just the tools that you need.  Please note that the indicated installation sizes for the components listed in the installer UI are not accurate and underestimate the total size.  

    * To successfully create Win32 projects in the C++ desktop workload, you must install both a toolset and a Windows SDK. Installing the recommended (selected) components “VC++ 2017 v141 toolset (x86, x64)” and “Windows 10 SDK (10.0.14393)” will ensure this will work.  If the necessary tools are not installed, projects will not be created successfully and the wizard will hang.

* Linux Development with C++:  

    * The popular extension [Visual C++ for Linux Development](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/725025cf-7067-45c2-8d01-1e0fd359ae6e) is now part of Visual Studio. This installation provides everything you need to develop and debug C++ applications running on a Linux environment.  

* Game Development with C++:  

    * Use the full power of C++ to build professional games powered by DirectX or Cocos2d.  

* Mobile Development with C++ (Android and iOS):  

    * You can now create and debug mobile apps using Visual Studio that can target Android and iOS.  

* Universal Windows Platform development:

    * C++ comes as an optional component for the Universal Windows Platform development workload.  Upgrading C++ projects currently must be done manually. If you open a v140-targeted UWP project in Visual Studio 2017, you need to select the v141 platform toolset in the project property pages if you do not have Visual Studio 2015 installed.

#### Clang/C2 Platform Toolset
The Clang/C2 toolset that ships with Visual Studio 2017 now supports the /bigobj switch, which is crucial for building large projects. It also includes several important bug fixes, both in the front-end and the back-end of the compiler.

### <a id="csharpvb"> </a>C\# and Visual Basic
#### Language Extensions
This release introduces support for C# 7.0 and Visual Basic 15 language features, including:

For C#:
* [Task-like return types for async methods](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/7169 "Task-like return types"): this introduces the ability to return any task-like type from an async method.  Previously these return types were constrained to `Task<T>` and `Task`.
* [Value tuples](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/features/tuples.md "Value tuples") introduce language support for using tuples to temporarily group a set of typed values. To learn more, please review the [design notes](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/features/tuples.md "Tuple Feature Specification") on GitHub.
* [Nested local functions](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/259 "Nested local functions") extend the language to support declaration of functions in a block scope.
* [Pattern matching extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/features/patterns.md "Pattern matching") enable many of the benefits of algebraic data types and pattern matching from functional languages.
* [Ref returns](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/118 "Ref returns") enable functions to return values by reference.

For Visual Basic:
* [Value tuples](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/11370) introduce language support for using tuples to temporarily group a set of typed values: `Dim point As (x As Integer, y As Integer) = GetOffset()`.
* [ByRef return consumption](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/11370) extend the language to support consumption of functions and properties from libraries which have ByRef returns.
* Binary literals and digit group separators allow native representation of binary numbers. This is super convenient for bitmasks and flags enumerations: `&B1001_0011`.

For more information, follow our language design on the [CSharpLang GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) and [VBLang GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/vblang) to learn more about these and other proposed language extensions.


##### Quick Actions and Refactorings
Visual Studio provides lots of refactorings to help you be productive and make your code more readable. Here are just a few:
* Simplify object initialization with an initializer *(Figure 20)*.

<img src="media/ObjectInitializer-2.png" alt="Use object initializer" width="310" height="183" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 20) Use object initializer*</center>

* Move `out` variable declarations inline, leveraging a new C#7 feature *(Figure 21)*.

<img src="media/inlinevariabledecl-2.png" alt="Move out variable inline" width="310" height="155" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 21) Move out variable inline*</center>

* Simplify null-checks and throw-expressions using null-coalescing operator, leveraging a new C#7 feature *(Figure 22)*.

<img src="media/UseThrowExpression-2.png" alt="Use throw expression with null-coalescing operator" width="310" height="166" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 22) Use throw expression with null-coalescing operator*</center>

* Move type to matching file: Extract a type from one file and put it in another file with a matching name with one click via `Ctrl+`.
* Sync file and type name: If your file and type name are out of sync, you can use `Ctrl+`.
* Convert `String.Format` to string interpolation: take advantage of the [C# 6 language feature](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn961160.aspx) with this Quick Action.
* Add missing case(s) to a C# switch or a Visual Basic Select.
* Convert property to a method, and vice versa.
* Add Package Reference: Offers to auto-retrieve and install a NuGet package (and add the using/Import) for an unrecognized type. To enable this feature, go to Tools > Options > Text Editor > [C# / Basic] > Advanced > Suggest usings for types in reference assemblies / Suggest usings for types in NuGet packages.
* Make async methods synchronous where applicable.
* Support for "fuzzy" matching for misspelled types.


##### Coding Convention Configuration and Enforcement
Building on Visual Studio's support for [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/), we worked with the community to add .NET code style settings to the file format. This means that you can configure your team's code style conventions, check them into source control,
and have violations appear live in the editor as developers are typing. You can see all the code style options in the Roslyn repo's [.editorconfig](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/.editorconfig)
or in [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/create-portable-custom-editor-options). You can continue to configure your machine-specific code style settings in Tools > Options > Text Editor > [C#/Basic] > Code Style and these rules are overridden when an EditorConfig is present and conflicts.

We've also added/updated style analyzers to help you customize and enforce coding conventions on your team, including:
* Naming style rules.
* Use of “var” or explicit types.
* Use of “this.” or “Me.” on member access.
* Use expression-bodies or blocks.
* Use pattern-matching for 'cast' and 'null' checks.
* Use explicit tuple names.
* Simplify null-checking with throw-expressions, conditional delegates, coalescing expressions, and null propagation.
* Require braces.

Note: several of these code style rules are configured as Suggestions in the editor by default *(Figure 23)*.

<img src="media/EditorConfig-2.png" alt="Configure code style preferences and enforcement from EditorConfig" width="717" height="335" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 23) Configure code style preferences and enforcement from EditorConfig*</center>

#### IntelliSense Improvements
This release also introduces improvements to IntelliSense that will make you more productive when working in a large solution or an unfamiliar codebase.
We have added an icon tray to IntelliSense that enables you to filter the member list by type (e.g., methods, properties, classes, etc.).
Each filter toggle has an associated keyboard shortcut which you can discover by hovering over the icon. To enable this feature, go to Tools > Options > Text Editor > [C# / Basic] > IntelliSense and check the options for filtering and highlighting *(Figure 24)*.

<img src="media/IntelliSenseCompletionFiltering-2.png" alt="IntelliSense Completion Filtering" width="310" height="175" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 24) IntelliSense Completion Filtering*</center>

#### Other Editor Improvements

* You can now split a long string into multiple concatenated strings by positioning the cursor mid-string and pressing `Enter`.
* We have done considerable work to improve responsiveness of the IDE in presence of background operations that compute diagnostics and CodeLens information.

### <a id="javascripttypescript"> </a> JavaScript and TypeScript
#### TypeScript 2.1
TypeScript 2.1 is available for all TypeScript projects in Visual Studio.
TypeScript 2.1 delivers down-level async/await, better type inference, local object expansion, and more!
To read more about the release, check out [the release blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/12/07/announcing-typescript-2-1/) or [the full change log](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What%27s-new-in-TypeScript).

#### JavaScript Language Service
A new JavaScript language service *(Figure 25)* is available and enabled by default.
The new service provides richer IntelliSense and adds IntelliSense support for JSDoc comment annotations, ES6, and Common JS module formats.
It also supports JSX syntax and features from ES2016, such as generators, modules, and decorators.
For more information, see [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/11/28/more-productive-javascript-in-visual-studio-2017-rc/) or the [JavaScript IntelliSense documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/javascript-intellisense) on GitHub.

<center>*(Figure 25) Rich JavaScript IntelliSense for jQuery*</center>

#### Performance Improvements
Improving performance was one of the greatest focuses of this release. Along with several optimizations to improve memory and responsiveness characteristics, the entire JavaScript/TypeScript language service has been moved to a satellite process outside of `devenv.exe` to provide memory relief to the largest VS projects.
You will see lower memory consumption from the Visual Studio process and less out of memory crashes when working with huge JavaScript projects.
To read more about these improvements, check out [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/10/12/reduced-out-of-memory-crashes-in-visual-studio-15/).

### <a id="debug"> </a> Debugging and Diagnostics
#### Run to Click
Simply click the icon next to a line of code while debugging to run to that line *(Figure 26)*. No longer set temporary breakpoints or perform several steps to execute your code and stop on the line you want. Now while stopped at a break state under the debugger, the Run to Click icon subtly appears next to the line of code that your mouse is hovered over. Move your mouse to the icon and click the button, now your code will run and stop on that line the next time it is hit in your code path.
 Turn it off from Debug> Options > Enable Run to Click.

<img src="media/RunToClick0-3.png" alt="Run to Click Icon" width="310" height="89" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 26) Run to Click Icon*</center>

#### Attach to Process Filter
Easily search in the Attach to Process dialog *(Figure 27)* to quickly find the process you want to attach the debugger to. The list of running processes will be filtered to items matching your search. The search filter is sticky and will remember your previous search when you reopen the dialog.

<img src="media/AttachFilter-2.png" alt="Attach to Process Filter" width="460" height="107" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 27) Attach to Process Filter*</center>

#### Reattach to Process
You can now quickly reattach to processes you were previously debugging. Triggering the new Debug/Reattach to Process (Shift+Alt+P) command will immediately try to attach the debugger to the last processes from the previous debugging session that were invoked from the Attach to Process dialog. The debugger will reattach to processes by first attempting to match the previous process ID and then by matching to the previous process name. If no matches are found or there are multiple processes found with the same name, then the "Attach to Process" dialog will appear so you can select the intended process.  

#### The New Exception Helper
Use the new Exception Helper *(Figure 28)* to view your exception information at a glance in a compact non-modal dialog with instant access to inner exceptions. While diagnosing your NullReferenceException, you can now quickly see what was null from right inside the Exception Helper. You can now exclude breaking on exception types thrown from specific modules by clicking the checkbox to add a condition while stopped at the thrown exception. [Read this blog post for more detailed information on the new benefits of the Exception Helper.](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/03/31/using-the-new-exception-helper-in-visual-studio-15-preview/)

<center>*(Figure 28) The New Exception Helper dialog*</center>

#### Add Conditions to Exception Settings
When you configure the debugger to break on thrown exceptions, you can add conditions so that the debugger will only break when exceptions are thrown in specified modules *(Figure 29)*.

<img src="media/Debugging.png" alt="Edit Conditions dialog box" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 29) Edit Conditions dialog box*</center>

#### Debugger Accessibility Improvements
You can now more effectively use several of the Debugger windows (Call Stack, Locals, Autos, Watch, and Quickwatch) with screen readers and for other accessibility needs.

#### IntelliTrace Events for .NET Core
IntelliTrace now supports MVC, ADO.NET, and HttpClient events for [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest) apps. These will appear in the Events tab in the Diagnostic Tools Window.

#### Diagnostic Tools Window Updates
When you start a debugging session, you'll see a new Summary view *(Figure 30)* of your application in the Diagnostic Tools Window. From here, you'll be able to:
* View the number of [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-visual-studio/) and [UI Analysis](#UIAnalysis) events (for UWP apps only) that have occurred in your application. In Visual Studio Enterprise, you'll also be able to see the number of Exceptions and [IntelliTrace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt243851.aspx) events.
* Take a [memory snapshot](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2014/11/13/memory-usage-tool-while-debugging-in-visual-studio-2015/) of your heap.
* Enable and disable [CPU profiling](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2015/10/29/profile-your-cpu-in-the-debugger-in-visual-studio-2015/).

<center>*(Figure 30) Summary tab in Diagnostics Tools Window*</center>

#### Performance Profiler Updates
The [Performance Profiler](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt210448.aspx "Performance Profiler") can now attach to a running process. The CPU Usage tool, GPU Usage tool, and Performance Wizard now support attaching to a running process.

#### CPU Usage Tool Updates
Several improvements have been made to the [CPU Usage Tool](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2015/10/29/profile-your-cpu-in-the-debugger-in-visual-studio-2015/ "CPU Usage Tool"):

* Better External Code support - The CPU Tool now gives you better insights into the costs of library and framework functions when called by user code.  
* Functions view *(Figure 31)* - A view that ranks functions by their CPU cost.

<img src="media/flatfunctions.png" alt="Functions List" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 31) Functions List*</center>

* Caller/Callee View *(Figure 32)* allows you to investigate costs of function calls made to and from a selected function.

<center>*(Figure 32) Caller / Callee View*</center>
* Source View shows a function's source code when the function is selected in the CPU Tool.

#### Chrome Debugging Support
When you start debugging ASP.NET projects and choose Google Chrome as your browser, Visual Studio will debug your JavaScript running in Chrome. If you prefer to use the in-browser development tools instead, you can disable this feature under Tools > Options > Debugging.

### <a id="teamexplorer"> </a> Team Explorer
#### New Git Features
We've added new Git features to Visual Studio 2017 that allow you to do more of your end-to-end workflow without leaving the IDE.
You can easily view the diff for outgoing commits, perform a force push to complete a rebase or push an amended commit, unset your upstream branch, and continue a patch rebase from VS.
Additionally, we have moved to git.exe. This allows us to provide the most up-to-date features. We support SSH, respect your config options, and show in Team Explorer exactly what you see in the command line.
To learn more about these features, check out the [blog post](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=842504).

#### Connect to VSTS/TFS
On the Visual Studio start page and in Team Explorer, the process for connecting to projects and cloning repos in VSTS/TFS has been personalized and streamlined, making it faster and easier to find the projects and repos to connect to.
Our brand new Connect page shows only the projects and repos that you have mapped and cloned across all your VSTS/TFS servers (rather than every repo for every project). Additionally, you no longer need to connect to a project before cloning repos.

When you launch the dialog to connect to VSTS and TFS, you will see the redesigned UX. You will see any TFS servers you've added followed by all VSTS servers, projects, and repos for your selected user account. The results are listed in a tree to allow for improved navigation. You can connect to collections or projects in addition to repos.
For more information, see [Connect to Team Projects](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/connect/connect-team-projects).

#### Work Item Forms
When you connect to Visual Studio Team Services from Visual Studio 2017 and open a work item, the work item form will appear in your web browser *(Figure 37)*. However, if you connect to Team Foundation Server 2015 or earlier, you will see the legacy work item forms.

<img src="media/TeamExplorer-2.png" alt="Work Item Form in Team Explorer" width="450" height="304" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 37) Work Item Form in Team Explorer*</center>

### <a id="ReportAProblem"> </a> Enhanced Visual Studio Feedback Workflow
Visual Studio 2017 includes an upgraded feedback experience for better follow-up and collaboration.
As part of this upgrade, you will notice a more collaborative Report-a-Problem experience in Visual Studio supplemented by a comprehensive [web portal]( https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/index.html)
for a complete end-to-end feedback solution. You can now search, follow, vote, and get the latest updates on all feedback you have provided via Visual Studio IDE’s Report a Problem feature.
These enhanced experiences address much of the feedback we received from you and enable bidirectional communication between our teams and you.

****

### <a id="extensibility"> </a> Visual Studio Extensibility
#### New Extensibility Format
The new installer technology in Visual Studio 2017 gives you greater control over the tools that are installed.  Some users may install just the core Visual Studio editor while others may install several workloads.  To ensure that the prerequisite features and extensions required are installed, extension authors will now be able to specify the individual components required by their extension in the manifest.

Users will be warned when trying to install an extension that was not built using the new VSIX format.  The old VSIX format does not specify prerequisites needed and may fail to work if those prerequisites are unavailable in Visual Studio 2017.  The new VSIX format is backwards compatible and can target past versions of Visual Studio up until Visual Studio 2012.

The VSIX manifest designer has been updated to reflect the changes to the manifest.  In the prerequisite tab *(Figure 38)*, extension developers can find a list of installed components to specify as a prerequisite for their extension.

<img src="media/Prerequisite.png" alt="Prerequisite" width="773" height="290" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 38) Prerequisite tab*</center>

During the installation of the extension, the VSIX installer *(Figure 39)* will indicate which components are missing and will install them alongside the extension.

<img src="media/Installer.png" alt="VSIXInstaller" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 39) VSIXInstaller*</center>

#### Modify Extensions in Bulk
In the Extensions and Updates dialog *(Figure 40)*, you can now schedule multiple extensions for installation, update, and uninstallation before needing to restart Visual Studio. In the lower right corner, there is a summary of the scheduled tasks. To remove a scheduled modification, click the X next to an extension that is currently scheduled to install.

<img src="media/EUDialog.png" alt="Extensions and Updates Dialog" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 40) Extensions and Updates Dialog*</center>

Once the VSIX Installer has detected that all Visual Studio windows are closed, it will start to complete the scheduled modifications *(Figure 41)*.

<img src="media/BatchModify.png" alt="Batched Modification Installer" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 41) Batched Modification Installer*</center>

#### Ngen Support
You can now choose to install assemblies using Ngen *(Figure 42)*.

<img src="media/NGEN.png" alt="NGEN Properties" width="326" height="89" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 42) NGEN Properties*</center>

* Ngen - Whether or not to use Ngen on the assembly.
* Ngen Application - The application to pass into Ngen via the /ExeConfig switch.
* Ngen Architecture - The target architecture for the native image.  Options are: x86, x64, and all.
* Ngen Priority - Ngen priority level.

#### Install Files Outside of Extension Directory
You can now choose to install files to a select list of folders that are outside of the extension directory *(Figure 43)*.

<img src="media/VSIX.png" alt="VSIX Properties" width="315" height="90" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 43) VSIX Properties*</center>

* Include in VSIX - Include the file in your VSIX.
* Install Root - The root directory to install the file.  Options are: Default (install inside the extension directory), PublicAssemblies, ReferenceAssemblies, MSBuild, Schemas, Licenses, RemoteDebugger, and VSTargets.
* Target Path - The name of the file to be installed on the user's machine.
* VSIX Sub Path - The sub path under the Install Root where the file will be installed.

#### <a id="extmanager"> </a> Roaming Extension Manager
New in Visual Studio 2017, the Roaming Extension Manager helps you keep track of your favorite extensions across all of your development environments. Roaming your extensions keeps track of the extensions you have installed by creating a synchronized list in the cloud.

When you sign into Visual Studio, you can quickly see a list of your extensions from Tools > Extensions and Updates, and click Roaming Extension Manager *(Figure 44)*. It tracks which extensions you have installed and lets you choose which ones are added to your Roaming list. With new extensions appearing in the gallery every day, this tool makes it quick and easy to set up each dev environment with your favorite extensions.

<img src="media/RoamingExtensionManager_v2.png" alt="The new Roaming Extension Manager in the Visual Studio IDE" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 44) The new Roaming Extension Manager in the Visual Studio IDE*</center>

When using this feature, you will notice 3 icon types:
* ![Roamed Icon](media/roamedicon.png "Roamed Icon") Roamed Icon - Denotes an extension that is part of your Roaming List, but not installed on this machine. You can install these via the "Download" button.
* ![Roamed and Installed Icon](media/roamedinstalledicon.png "Roamed and Installed Icon") Roamed & Installed Icon - Denotes all extensions that are part of your Roaming List and installed in this environment. If you decide you do not want to roam, you can remove these via the "Stop Roaming" button.
* ![Installed Icon](media/installedicon.png "Installed Icon") Installed Icon - Denotes all extensions that are installed in this environment, but are not part of your Roaming List. Extensions can be added to roaming list via the "Start Roaming" button.

These icons will show you the current status of your list. You can have any extension in any state, so customize to your heart's content! Or let us do it for you! Any extension downloaded while you are signed in will be added to your list as  Roamed & Installed and will therefore be part of your Roaming list, giving you access to it from any machine!

#### <a id="exttemplate"> </a>Discovery of Project and Item Templates
Starting in Visual Studio 2017, there is a breaking change with how Visual Studio consumes project and item templates to improve the performance of template discovery.
The new discovery mechanism now requires all item and project templates following "vstemplate" schema to be defined in template manifest files. Visual Studio templates
that you do not define in a template manifest file will no longer be visible in New Project or New Item dialogs. While the new extensibility tooling will generate a
manifest during VSIX build time, if you have Visual Studio templates released as part of an MSI package, you must manually generate template manifest files for those
templates. For more information, see the [Upgrading Custom Project and Item Templates for Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/upgrading-custom-project-and-item-templates-for-visual-studio-2017) MSDN page.

****

### <a id="dotnetcore"> </a>.NET Core and ASP.NET Core
This contains the 1.0 final release of the new MSBuild based .NET Core Tools. Using Visual Studio 2017, you can create .NET Standard libraries, .NET Core apps/libraries and ASP.NET web projects that use the new csproj format.

.NET Core tooling is automatically included in the “ASP.NET and web development” workload and an optional component in the “.NET desktop development” workload in the installer. If you only want to develop .NET Core applications for cross platform use, you can install just the .NET Core and ASP.NET Core tools using the “.NET Core cross-platform development” workload from the “Other Toolsets” section of the installer.

High-level features in this release include the following:

* MSBuild support for .NET Core projects, with a simplified csproj project format that makes it easier to edit by hand, without the need to unload the project.
* Editing .NET Core .csproj file is as simple as a right click on project in Solution Explorer and choosing “Edit”.
* Support for file wildcards in project file, where you don’t have to enumerate all the source code file names, which keeps the csproj file compact in size.
* NuGet package references are now part of the csproj file, consolidating all project references in one file.
* Interop between .NET Core, .NET Standard and .NET Framework projects. For example, a .NET Core project can add a project-to-project reference to a .NET Standard project.
* Cross-target multiple target frameworks in one project.
* Existing project.json .NET Core projects will automatically migrate to csproj when opened in Visual Studio, or you can manually [migrate them using the .NET Command Line Interface (CLI).] (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=842521)
* Easily configure continuous build integration for your ASP.NET Core application with Docker support and continuous build delivery to your Azure Container Services from within the Visual Studio IDE.

See the [.NET blog](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=842827) for more details.

### <a id="apache"> </a>Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova
This Visual Studio 2017 release includes the following improvements:

* **Cordova simulate** - A new browser-based simulator enables you to code fast and see the results immediately in the browser *(Figure 46)*. Live reload, plugin simulation, and support for Ionic Framework give Visual Studio the fastest developer workflow on the market.

<img src="media/tacosimulate.png" alt="Cordova simulate" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 46) Cordova simulate*</center>

* **Support for iOS 10 & XCode 8** - An update of the `remotebuild` server agent for iOS development now includes support for XCode 8.

* **Error colorization** - Because diagnosing build failures often requires developers to read through build output, we have started to colorize errors in the build output pane for easier reading *(Figure 47)*. Moreover, we have added headers to delineate steps in the build process to help developers identify where in the build process the failure occurred.

<img src="media/tacobuildoutput-47.png" alt="Pretty printing" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 47) Colorized Errors*</center>

* **In-product acquisition** - In addition to the new light-weight installation to get you building Cordova apps faster, we have now added pathways from within Visual Studio to acquire additional build pieces as your development continues *(Figure 48)*. If you have not installed Android or Windows components, you can get them through the deploy bar, which will launch Visual Studio setup and guide you through the installation process.

<img src="media/taco-IPA.png" alt="In-product acquisition" style="border:2px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 48) In-product acquisition*</center>

* **Fast, reliable builds** - The new Visual Studio Installer, combined with offline installation of a fully validated toolchain of 3rd party components, provides for faster builds that are also easier to troubleshoot and fix.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Build tools and emulators for Android and Windows are now optional. You can acquire them dynamically through the build/deploy menu bar. This release of Visual Studio does not support Windows Store 8.1 projects. We recommend that you update your Cordova projects to target Windows 10. Minimum supported Cordova version is raised to 6.0.0. Projects targeting a Cordova version lower than 6.0.0 will need to upgrade their project in ```config.xml``` to build and deploy in Visual Studio 2017.

### <a id="nuget"> </a>NuGet
Visual Studio 2017 includes NuGet 4.0. This release is focused on supporting package reference for the majority project types, quality improvements, and performance improvements:
* In WPF, WindowsForms, and UWP projects, packages can now be managed using [package references](https://aka.ms/packagereferencesupport).
* NuGet restore support has been improved for Lightweight Solution Restore. Restores can now be performed without needing to load any projects.
* In .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects, packages are now managed using [package references](https://aka.ms/packagereferencesupport).
* In Visual Studio 2017 and above, the machine-wide NuGet.config is now located at %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\NuGet\Config\NuGet.config. Going forward, nuget.exe v4.0.0 + will also consider the new location for the machine-wide configuration. NuGet.config in program data will no longer be implicitly referenced or considered for the hierarchical merging of nuget.config.

****

### <a id="xaml"> </a>Tools for XAML Apps
#### XAML Edit & Continue
Visual Studio now allows you to edit XAML while your WPF or Universal Windows App is running. While debugging your app in Visual Studio, you can make a change to the markup in the XAML code editor and the change will be reflected in the running app without having to recompile.

#### XAML Editor Productivity Enhancements
* **IntelliSense filtering** - When typing XAML, the completion list will only display types that match and the closest match will be selected.
* **IntelliSense for x:Bind** - We have enabled IntelliSense completion for x:Bind when binding to Path and Events.
* **Namespace completion** -  If the reference to the namespace does not exist *(Figure 50)*, you will not get IntelliSense support while typing. When you have finished typing, you will get light bulb suggestion support to generate & insert the prefix for the type and add the namespace definition in your XAML document.


<img src="media/intelliSense_without namespace.PNG" alt="IntelliSense_without namespace" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 50) IntelliSense_without namespace*</center>
    * For types that require a prefix, IntelliSense will offer to auto-complete the prefix if the reference to the namespace already exists.

<br>

* **Namespace prefix rename refactoring** - You can invoke the rename action *(Figure 51)* from the context menu or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+R+R` when the cursor is on the prefix. You can also preview changes before applying them.

<img src="media/namespace prefix rename.PNG" alt="Namespace Prefix Rename" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">  
<center>*(Figure 51) Namespace prefix rename*</center>
   <br>

* **Remove and sort namespaces** - You can now remove unnecessary namespaces *(Figure 52)* and sort them from the context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+R+G`.  If your XAML document has unnecessary namespaces, you will also see a light bulb that will give you the option to remove them.

<img src="media/lightbulb_remove unnecessary namespace.PNG" alt="Lightbulb_remove unnecessary namespace" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 52) lightbulb_remove unnecessary namespace*</center>
<br>

* **.editorconfig support for XAML editor** - You can define settings for indent_style, indent_size, and tab_width in the .editorconfig file which will be used instead of the settings defined in **Tools > Options**.

* **Structure Visualizer for XAML editor** - The structure visualizer (i.e. indent guides) *(Figure 53)* is now built into Visual Studio, and a separate extension is not required. This feature provides the context of the block of code you are working on at a glance, without scrolling.

<img src="media/Structure_Visualizer.PNG" alt="Structure Visualizer for XAML editor" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 53) Structure Visualizer for XAML editor*</center>
<br>

#### XAML Performance Improvements
* **Improved XAML Tab Switch performance** - XAML Tab Switch performance has improved significantly. In sample customer projects, we have seen switching time reduce by over 90%.  
* **Addressing XAML editor typing delays** - XAML typing is now faster than ever. We have made several investments to reduce XAML editor typing delays, and most developers should find the XAML editor and XAML IntelliSense to be more responsive. This will be most apparent when editing a XAML file in projects that consume third party controls or large control libraries.
