## Details: What's New in this Release
### <a id="Accessibility"> </a> Accessibility
We addressed over 1,700 accessibility issues in this release and made Visual Studio more accessible than ever.
You have access to the new “Blue (Extra Contrast)” theme *(Figure 1)*. This theme offers you more contrast than the regular "Blue" theme if you don't want or need the full High Contrast mode.

 <img src="media/BlueTheme.png" alt="BlueTheme" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 1) Blue (Extra Contrast) theme*</center>

With Visual Studio Editor, you can discover and navigate between text adornments via the new "Show Line Annotations" command set. You can find the new feature on the **Editor context menu** *(Figure 2)*.  See the [Visual Studio Editor](#VSEditor153) section for more information.

 <img src="media/ShowLineAnnotation.png" alt="Show Line Annotations" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 2) Show Line Annotations*</center>

### <a id="azstack"</a> Azure Stack and Azure Government Clouds
Use all the same tools in Visual Studio &#8212; like Cloud Explorer, Connected Services and ASP.NET Publish &#8212; to connect Azure Stack and government clouds. Pick an existing government cloud, like Azure in China *(Figure 3)*, or enter the  discovery endpoint for your organization’s Azure Stack.

 <img src="media/AzureStack.jpg" alt="Azure Stack" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 3) Azure Stack*</center>

### <a id="azfunctions"></a> Azure Function Tools
* Tools for developing C# Azure Functions are included as part of the “Azure development” workload.
* You can develop Azure functions by using pre-compiled C# class libraries, and attributes to specify triggers.
* You can build, run, and debug on your local development machine.
* You can publish directly to Azure from Visual Studio.

For more details, see the [Visual Studio 2017 Tools for Azure Functions](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2017/05/10/azure-function-tools-for-visual-studio-2017/) blog post.

****

### <a id="dotnetcoreimprovements15P3"> </a> .NET Core and ASP.NET Core
* You can install .NET Core 2.0 SDK via a separate download to enable .NET Core 2.0 development in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3. Visual Studio now provides side-by-side support of multiple .NET Core SDKs. You can experiment with the latest daily build of the .NET Core SDK while you develop with the latest public release of the SDK. See [.NET blog](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=853702) for details.
* With Visual Basic support, you now have the ability to create .NET Core console applications, and .NET Core, and .NET Standard class libraries in Visual Basic.
* .NET Framework and .NET Standard/Core interop allows you to refer to .NET Core/.NET Standard libraries from .NET Framework projects and vice versa. No need to manually add interop NuGet packages – Visual Studio does this for you automatically.
* Multiple target framework support enhancement allows you to build your project for multiple target frameworks (TFM), and use the TFM picker in **Debug/Run** to pick the TFM to run.
* We added Windows Nano Server image support for containerizing ASP.NET Core apps as Windows Nano Server images. You can now select Windows Nano Server as the container platform. You can do this under **File->New Project** for ASP.NET Core projects. For your existing projects, it can be added using the **Project Context Menu**.
* Local IIS support: You can now develop and debug using IIS from Visual Studio.
* ASP.NET Core on .NET Framework – When you create an ASP.NET Core project targeting the full .NET Framework (Windows only), you will use the dropdown on the One ASP.NET dialog.
* The Live Unit Testing feature can be enabled for your .NET Standard, .NET Core, and ASP.NET Core projects.

#### Service Fabric Tools
This release provides a new stateful ASP.NET Core project template, support for both 2.5 and 2.6 SDK's (and corresponding runtimes) of Service Fabric, as well as several bug fixes.

#### Continuous Delivery Tools
We moved these features from the CD4VS (Microsoft Continuous Delivery Tools for Visual Studio) extension into Visual Studio:
* Configure continuous delivery for solutions that contain ASP.NET projects targeting an Azure App Service.
* Configure continuous delivery for solutions that contain ASP.NET Core projects targeting an Azure App Service.

****

### <a id="IDEimprovements15"> </a> Visual Studio IDE
* We added the **Keyboard Accessibility menu** command under the **"Help" menu**. This provides you with a shortcut to online documention about Accessibility Tips and Tricks.
* The diagnostic system informs you via the **InfoBar** about extensions that might have been involved in an unexpected termination of Visual Studio *(Figure 4)*. The **InfoBar** provides this information about the termination and asks if you would like to disable the suspected extension.

 <img src="media/InfoBar.png" alt="InfoBar" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 4) InfoBar notification*</center>

* In open folder scenarios, you can select your desired debugger via dedicated UI.
* We’ve stopped sharing certain settings, like tool window layout, between different side-by-side installations of Visual Studio 2017. For more information, see the [Synchronize your settings in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/synchronized-settings-in-visual-studio#side-by-side-synchronized-settings) documentation.
* We fixed the "hidden window" bug that made Visual Studio appear to hang before its main window appeared.
* We increased the clickable target area to make it easier to dismiss notification tips.

#### .NET IDE

* We added several new refactorings and quick fixes, like "Resolve merge conflicts", "Add null checks", "Add parameter", and many more. Take a look at our [Refactoring, Code Generation and Quick Actions in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/refactoring-code-generation-quick-actions) page to see the full list.
* We suggest variable names in IntelliSense to help you name your variables quickly, for example, ```Person person```.
* **Edit and Continue** supports C# 7.0 features (except local functions).
* We added support for file globbing outside of your project folder for .NET Core.

#### Sign In and Identity
We fixed the **account picker control** so "Re-enter credentials" works more reliably. In some cases, the account picker would clear accounts upon re-entering credentials.

#### Start Page
We increased the clickable target area on Start Page MRU “pins”. It's easier to pin items you care about to the top of the MRU.

#### Lightweight Solution Load
* We increased build speed and stability.
* We reduced the number of loaded projects.
* We added a new option *(Figure 5)* that allows Visual Studio to decide what’s best for your solution.

<img src="media/LSLOptions.jpg" alt="Lightweight Solution Load Options" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 5) Lightweight Solution Load Options*</center>

* We added file search results solutions to search for deferred projects, instead of just loaded projects.  
  * When you load a project, all existing searches are refreshed to add progression results.
  * There are limits to this:
    * Search does not extend within the file and does not include progressive results, i.e. classes, methods, etc.
    * Files that belong to a project are shown as a flat list. When files belong to a folder, the relative path is shown instead of just the file name.
    * There are no context menus for the file items in the search view.
* **GoTo All** and **GoTo Files** show content from external items in the workspace.
* We improved Batch build in projects that use Lightweight Solution Load.

#### Setup
* Visual Studio Installer now supports high-DPI scaling at levels less than 150%.
* The `vswhere.exe` executable file has been updated to exclude preview instances by default, and includes them when `--prerelease` is included on the command line.
* CLI is able to handle `--verify`, `--fix` and `--clean`.
   * `--verify` verifies layout and informs you of missing and invalid payloads.
   * `--fix` verifies the layout and re-downloads packages that are either missing or invalid.
   * `--clean` deletes obsolete packages and allows you to trim layout to a specific version range.
* We added details that show the net size impact per drive to the installation details page. *(Figure 6)*.

<img src="media/DriveSize.png" alt="Drive Sizes in the Installer" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 6) Drive Sizes listed in the Installer*</center>

****

### <a id="VSEditor153"> </a> Visual Studio Editor
* Manual scroll and selection are no longer difficult when a large numbers of errors are being added.
* We added a new variant of the "Blue" theme, which caters specifically to users who need more contrast in the Visual Studio Editor. This theme offers you more contrast than the regular "Blue" theme if you don't want or need the full High Contrast mode. You can try it out via **Tools -> Options -> Environment -> General**.
* If you use a screen-reader, you can now navigate between adornments by using the new **"Show Line Annotations"** command.
  * To activate, select "Show Line Annotations" (`Ctrl+K`, `Ctrl+M`) on the **Editor context menu**. A popup will appear in the editor describing the adornments on that line.
  * Navigate through multiple annotations on the line using `Ctrl+K`, `Ctrl+ Right/Left Arrow`.
  * You can also easily find context in code through the "Show Structure" command `Ctrl+K`, `Ctrl+G`. This shows the structural context of the line of code in the popup where the caret is located, and can be read by the screen reader.

****
### <a id="Debugging"> </a>Debugging and Diagnostics
#### Debugger Support for Visual Studio Team Services Symbol Servers
* You can query and download symbols *(Figure 7)* from Visual Studio Team Services Symbol Servers. You can select and add Visual Studio Team Services symbol paths to your Visual Studio environment using the **Tools->Options->Debugger->Symbols** page. To set up a Visual Studio Team Services Symbol Server, see the [Use Symbol Server in Team Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=846265) page.  

<img src="media/vsts.jpg" alt="Add VSTS Symbol Server" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 7) Add VSTS Symbol Server*</center>
* The [SetThreadDescription API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/mt774976.aspx) is supported while debugging when you use Start Debugging (`F5`) or Attach to Process (`Ctrl+Alt+P`). The thread names that are set via this API now show up in the Threads window and in the Thread dropdown in the Debug Location toolbar. This is not currently supported while [dump debugging.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d5zhxt22.aspx)
* The Output Window now shows you the console output of an application running inside a Windows Container while debugging.
* We added new support for debugging .NET Core apps you run inside Windows Containers based on Windows Nano Server.

#### Point and Click to Set Next Statement
You can hold down the `Ctrl` key while stopped at a breakpoint when debugging. The `Run to Click` (Run execution to here) icon next to your line of code changes to “Set Next Statement” functionality *(Figure 8)*. Click the icon to move the yellow instruction pointer to that line and set the next statement for the debugger to execute.

<img src="media/setNextStatement.jpg" alt="Click to Set Next Statement" style="border:3px solid Silver; display: block; margin: auto;">
<center>*(Figure 8) Click to set Next Statement*</center>

#### Source Link Support for Windows PDB File Format
Source Link is now supported for Windows PDB file format (in addition to Portable PDBs). Compilers that support it can put the necessary information in the Windows PDB file format and the debugger can retrieve source files based on that information.

#### Open Folder Debugging
We have made your debugging experience easier when you use our new templates for Open Folder. If you have the core debugger installed, our new templates allow you to choose the type of debugger you want to use. Managed, Native, or Mixed can be chosen from the "Select a Debugger" dialog in the "Debug and Launch Settings" menu option in Solution Explorer. If you have a C++ MDD experience installed (Android C++, Linux Debugging, etc.), you now see options for [MinGW and Cygwin](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/07/19/using-mingw-and-cygwin-with-visual-cpp-and-open-folder) support by using GDB for attach and launch within the same menu option.

#### Refresh All Nested Values in Variable Windows
When you click the refresh button for the parent node of a variable or expression in the Watch, Autos, and Locals windows, all visible variables and expressions that are children of that node also refresh and re-evaluate. You no longer need to click on the refresh button for each of the children.

#### Live Unit Testing Support for .NET Core
You can enable the Live Unit Testing feature for .NET Standard, .NET Core, and ASP.NET Core projects.

For a complete overview of changes, be sure to check out [developer.xamarin.com](https://developer.xamarin.com/releases/vs/xamarin.vs_4/xamarin.vs_4.6/) for more details.

****

### Open Folder and <a id="cmake"> </a> CMake Tools
* We improved stability for toggling between folder and solution.
* Open folder extenders can add a source control icon to your folders. This allows you to quickly see the source control state of your files in Solution Explorer, which is currently implemented by SVN.
* The CMake experience in Visual Studio is upgraded to [CMake 3.8](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/06/14/cmake-support-in-visual-studio-whats-new-in-2017-15-3-preview-2/).
* We improved editing, building, and debugging support in "Open Folder" for C++ projects that use [MinGW or Cygwin](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/07/19/using-mingw-and-cygwin-with-visual-cpp-and-open-folder).
* We added support to define global and configuration-specific environment variables in "CppProperties.json" and "CMakeSettings.json". These environment variables can be consumed by debug configurations defined in "launch.vs.json" and tasks in "tasks.vs.json".
* We enhanced CMake tools for Visual Studio to provide you with support for [CTest integration](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/05/10/cmake-support-in-visual-studio-whats-new-in-2017-15-3-update).
* You can now use the [CMake's Ninja generator](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/06/14/cmake-support-in-visual-studio-whats-new-in-2017-15-3-preview-2/) to easily target 64-bit platforms, build, debug, and edit with IntelliSense.
