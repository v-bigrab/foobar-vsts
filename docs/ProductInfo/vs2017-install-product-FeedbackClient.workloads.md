# Visual Studio Feedback Client 2017 component directory

The tables below provide the IDs you can use to install Visual Studio using the command line. 

**Understanding this page**  

The tables on this page include the workload and component IDs you’ll need to install Visual Studio 2017 by using 
the command line. Note that we may add additional components as we release updates to Visual Studio.

Each workload has its own section on this page, followed by the workload ID and a table of the components that are 
available for the workload. By default, the **Required** components will be installed when you install the workload. 
If you choose to, you can also install the **Recommended** and **Optional** components. 

At the end of this page, we’ve added a section that lists the additional components that are not affiliated with any 
workload. For more information, see [Use Command-Line Parameters to Install Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio).

For a list of workload and component IDs for other products, see [Visual Studio 2017 Workload and Component IDs](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/productinfo/vs2017-install-product--list).
